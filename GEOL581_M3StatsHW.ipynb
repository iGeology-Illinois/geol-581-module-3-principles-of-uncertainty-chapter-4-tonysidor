    "A rock slope is to be cut as part of a road construction project. However, there is a risk that the slope could slide along the bedding planes into the excavation pit. In order to carry out a stability analysis it is necessary to estimate the angle of friction along the bedding planes. An initial assessment on the mean value of the friction angle can be obtained from the spectrum of possible manifestations of the friction angle. It cannot be smaller than the base friction angle, i.e. the friction angle that would result on the sawn, smooth surface of a specimen. The base friction angle for the greywackes that make up the slope is about 20°. The maximum possible friction angle can be estimated by back-calculating past failure cases. So far, no friction angle exceeding 35° has been back-calculated. What is the probability that the friction angle is smaller than 25°? Since no further information is available, the PDF of the friction angle can be assumed to be uniform."
